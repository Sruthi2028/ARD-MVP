## Administrative Reality Drift (ARD)

Administrative Reality Drift (ARD) is a simple governance metric that measures the gap between officially announced administrative plans and actual on-ground execution.

## Problem
Large public development projects often suffer from delays, policy changes, and execution inefficiencies. There is no easy way to quantify how much administration has drifted from its original plans.

## Solution
ARD converts key administrative execution factors into a single score (0–100) that indicates the level of administrative drift.

## ARD Score Meaning
- **0–20**: Strong administration  
- **21–40**: Minor execution gaps  
- **41–60**: Moderate drift  
- **61–80**: High drift  
- **81–100**: Administrative failure
